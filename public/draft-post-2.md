Possible Improvements for This Post:

More real-world examples (e.g., shopping lists, leaderboards)

Visual diagrams of memory allocation for arrays

Comparison with other structures (e.g., how arrays differ from objects)

Interactive code snippets (e.g., a repl.it demo)

Common pitfalls (e.g., off-by-one errors, sparse arrays)

Phase 1: Foundations
Arrays: The Ordered Storage System (current post)

Basics, operations, and performance.

Real-world analogies (warehouse shelves, playlist tracks).

Objects/Hash Maps: Key-Value Pairs

How they differ from arrays.

Use cases (dictionaries, caches).

Sections:
Introduction (What’s an Array?)

Definition: Ordered list of elements.

Real-world analogy (numbered shelves, playlist tracks).

Basic syntax (JavaScript/Python examples).

Key Properties

Indexing (0-based), length.

Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous arrays.

The 4 Core Operations (Main Focus)
A. Reading

Access by index (arr[2]).

Performance: O(1) → Instant.

B. Searching

Find index of a value (indexOf()).

Performance: O(n) → Linear scan.

C. Insertion

End (push()): O(1).

Middle (splice()): O(n) (shifting elements).

D. Deletion

End (pop()): O(1).

Middle (splice()): O(n) (shifting elements).

When to Use Arrays

Pros: Fast access by index, ordered data.

Cons: Slow searches/insertions in middle.

Common Pitfalls

Off-by-one errors.

Sparse arrays (undefined gaps).

What’s Next?

Preview: "Sets: Unique Collections".

Extras (Optional):
Diagram: ASCII array with indices.

Code Snippet: Interactive example (e.g., JSFiddle).

Exercise: "Reverse an array in-place."

Word Count Target: ~800-1,200 words.
