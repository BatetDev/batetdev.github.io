Possible Improvements for This Post:

More real-world examples (e.g., shopping lists, leaderboards)

Visual diagrams of memory allocation for arrays

Comparison with other structures (e.g., how arrays differ from objects)

Interactive code snippets (e.g., a repl.it demo)

Common pitfalls (e.g., off-by-one errors, sparse arrays)
